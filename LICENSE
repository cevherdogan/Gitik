> ðŸŒ± Note from the Author:

This license is more than a legal statementâ€”it's an invitation.

Gitik started not just as a command helper, but as a recognition of something deeper:  
that *patience* is the most misunderstood action in tech.

Patience isnâ€™t inaction. Itâ€™s preparation. Reflection. Listening.  
In a world running at AI-speedâ€”where code writes itself, tools anticipate us, and every click feeds another modelâ€”  
Gitik invites you to pause, understand, and contribute.

Every one-liner here holds a story. Each CLI flag is a fingerprint of experience.
