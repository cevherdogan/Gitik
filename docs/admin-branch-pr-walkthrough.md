## ✅ Plan Summary

# 🛠️ Admin Branch Log: Example PR for Gitik (v0.1.3)

## 📌 Purpose

This document serves as a **step-by-step trace** of a real Git workflow from the Gitik maintainer (admin) perspective. It's designed to:

- Model a clean GitOps flow for new contributors and future admins.
- Illustrate the full lifecycle of a local feature-to-main merge process.
- Reflect strategic governance decisions made in the early stages of Gitik.

## 🔖 Branch Name

```bash
admin/onboarding-log-v0.1.3
````

## 🗂️ What Was Done

1. **Created a new documentation article** distinct from `articles/article.md`

   * Goal: Serve as a visible working record (this file).
2. **Clarified role of this branch** as an admin path-setting prototype.
3. **Tagged and pushed** following clean Git practices.

## 🔁 Git Flow Used

```bash
# From main
git checkout -b admin/onboarding-log-v0.1.3

# Staged changes
git add docs/admin-branch-pr-walkthrough.md

# Commit
git commit -m "🧭 Add admin walkthrough for branching and PR workflow (v0.1.3 template)"

# Push branch
git push origin admin/onboarding-log-v0.1.3
```

## 📌 Next Step: Create Pull Request

Once pushed:

* Open a Pull Request from this branch to `main`
* Link this doc in PR body
* Optionally assign to self or another admin

---

## 🔖 Tagging Plan

After merge:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.3 -m "v0.1.3 – Admin-led onboarding flow and contributor guidance"
git push origin v0.1.3
```

## 👥 Open Source Participation Statement

As this repository grows into a community-driven template for safe, explainable Git workflows:

* **Additional admins** will be invited.
* This log will act as an onboarding reference.
* The hope is to scale Gitik into a public-facing model for responsibly transitioning private tools into the open domain.
