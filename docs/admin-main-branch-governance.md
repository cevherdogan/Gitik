# 🔐 Gitik Admin Guide: Main Branch Governance & Merge Protocols

This document outlines best practices for Gitik repository admins under the enforced `main` branch ruleset (MainLockRule).

Main is a **protected branch** with:
- Required Pull Request merges
- Optional status checks (recommended)
- No force-push allowed
- Admin-controlled merges only

---

## ✅ Admin Responsibilities

Admins must:

1. Enforce all changes via Pull Requests.
2. Prefer **squash merges** for clear, linear history.
3. Maintain versioned documentation and changelogs.
4. Encourage contributors to use structured branches and safe commit messages.

---

## 🧪 Example Admin Git Flow

```bash
# Start clean
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Branch for change
git checkout -b admin/<feature-or-doc>

# Work on changes
git add .
git commit -m "Clear message"
git push -u origin admin/<feature-or-doc>
````

---

## 📩 Pull Request Review & Merge

1. Review your own changes or request a peer admin review.
2. Use **Squash and Merge** in the GitHub UI.
3. Delete the branch after merge (optional but clean).


---

## ✅ PR Closure Protocol

- Ensure all intended changes are included and self-reviewed.
- Use **Squash Merge** for cleaner history.
- Tag and document the release if version-worthy.
- Clean up merged branches locally and remotely.
- Reflect closure and changes in `CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, and relevant documentation.


### Tagging (if versioned):

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v0.X.Y -m "v0.X.Y – Description of changes"
git push origin v0.X.Y
```

---

## 🔁 Keeping Local in Sync Post-Merge

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d admin/<your-branch>
git push origin --delete admin/<your-branch>  # optional
```

---

## 🏛️ Governance Recommendations

* Use [docs/git-workflow-guideline.md](./git-workflow-guideline.md) as the contributor-facing process.
* Protect other strategic branches in the future (`release/`, `stable/`, etc.).
* Encourage tagging for all admin merges to allow version checkpoints.

---
