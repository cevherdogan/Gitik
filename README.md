<img src="web/images/GitikButNeverBitik.png" alt="Gitik – Never Bitik" width="400"/>

Gitik is a command assistant and knowledge engine that turns your GitHub tasks into concise, safe, and explainable one-liners. Built on curated libraries and community input, it helps beginners and pros alike navigate Git, GitHub, and DevOps workflows with confidence.

## 📖 What does *Gitik* mean?

**Gitik** *(noun, slang)*  
From “git” + Turkish suffix “-ik”, meaning something simplified or miniaturized.  
Gitik makes Git friendly, fast, and fear-free.  
**In use:** “Bunu Gitik’le çözdüm.” — "Solved it with Gitik."

## 🔍 How It Works

Gitik is powered by logic engines and curated reference sets including:

- ✅ `one_liner_library.yaml` — Categorized GitHub, Git, Bash, Python commands
- ✅ `aws_only_tasks.yaml` — Git and GitHub tasks scoped to AWS workflows
- ✅ `github_actions_cases.yaml` — Use-case driven GitHub Actions examples

Each response includes:
- The safest command
- A non-jargon explanation
- Generalization/specialization tips

## 📚 Knowledge Sources

Gitik’s logic and examples are synthesized from:

- GitHub Docs & Developer Guides  
- AWS & GCP CLI tutorials  
- Popular GitHub Gists  
- Community-submitted one-liners
